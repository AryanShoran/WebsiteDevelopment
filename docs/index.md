### How does RedSec keep your device safe?
 

Our company works to secure the system of our clients by running penetration tests. These penetration tests help us identify and root out any viruses that may 
be in the customers system. 
This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target's vulnerabilities. Testers then try and exploit these vulnerabilities, typically by escalating privileges, stealing data, intercepting traffic, etc., to understand the damage they can cause. This also help us find how a particular application will respond to various intrusion attempts.
