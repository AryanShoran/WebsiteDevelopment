### How does RedSec keep your device safe?
 
Markup :  _Emphasized text_ or *Emphasized text*Our company works to secure the system of our clients by running penetration tests. These penetration tests help us identify and root out any viruses that may 
be in the customers system. 


This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target's vulnerabilities. Testers then try and exploit these vulnerabilities, typically by escalating privileges, stealing data, intercepting traffic, etc., to understand the damage they can cause. This also help us find how a particular application will respond to various intrusion attempts.

The results of the penetration test are then compiled into a report detailing:

    Specific vulnerabilities that were exploited
    Sensitive data that was accessed
    The amount of time the pen tester was able to remain in the system undetected
    
This information is analyzed by security personnel to help configure an enterprise’s WAF settings and other application security solutions to patch vulnerabilities and protect against future attacks.
